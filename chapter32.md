* Production Readiness Review (PRR) model- a process that identifies the reliability needs of a service based on its specific details

* phases of a PRR model-
	* engagement- initiates discussion with development team, covers: establishing SLOs/SLAs, planning for potentially disruptive design changes to improve reliability, planning and training schedules
	* analysis- analyzed for shortcomings, production best practices
	* improvements and refactoring- improvements are prioritized, priorities are discussed and negotiated, and both product development and SREs refactor parts of the service
	* training- design overviews, description of production setup, exercises for system operations
	* onboarding- progressively transfers responsibilities and ownership of various production aspects of the service
	* continuous improvement- service reliability standards must be maintained

* early engagement model- introduces SRE earlier in the development lifecycle, i.e. identifying the importance/business value of a service early on, and determining if the service will have sufficient scale/complexity to benefit from SREs

* structural solution for SRE-driven development- codified best practices, reusable solutions, a common production platform with a common control surface, easier automation and smarter systems
