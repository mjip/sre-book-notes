* production meetings- an SRE team articulates the state of the service(s) in their change, so as to increase general awareness, and to improve the operation of the service(s)
	* agenda- upcoming production changes (near term horizon visibility), metrics, outages, paging events, nonpaging events (issues that should've been paged, or require attention), prior action items

* SRE tech lead- responsible for technical direction in the team, commenting on code, holding quarterly direction presentations, building consensus in the team
