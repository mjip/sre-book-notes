* opertional load falls into three general categories-
	* pages- concern production alerts and their fallout, triggered in response to production emergencies (must always have an SLO)
	* tickets- concern customer requests that require you to take an action (can have an SLO, but measured in longer terms)
	* ongoing operational responsibilities- e.g. team-owned code or flag rollouts, responses to time-sensitive questions, etc

* flow state- being 'in the zone' can increase productivity, but can also increase artistic and scientific creativity

* a person should never be expected to be on-call and also make progress on projects (or anything else with a high context switching cost)
