* primary goals of writing a postmortem- ensure that the incident is documented, that all contributing root cause(s) are well understood, and that effective preventative actions are put in place to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of recurrence

* you can't fix people but you can fix systems and processes to better support people making the right choices when designing and maintaining complex systems

* the goal is to share postmortems to the widest possible audience that would benefit from the knowledge or lessons imparted
