* if the limit of incidents exceeds the upper bound for the quarter, corrective measures should be put in place to make sure that the operational load returns to a sustainable state

* the most important on-call resources- clear escalation paths, well-defined incident-management procedures, a blameless postmortem culture


* alerts should be grouped together by the monitoring/alerting system so that duplicate/uninformative alerts can be silenced together
